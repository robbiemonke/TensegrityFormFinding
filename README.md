# TensegrityFormFinding
Repository of the current code for the form finding of a single tensegrity vertebrae module using minimization of energy and zeros finding formulations. Includes MATLAB code of the implementation.

# MATLAB Code:
fFind.m - Implementation of minimization of energy form finding method. Plots the tensegrity module using both the semicircle model (vertebraePlotSemicircle.m) and stl model (vertebraePlotStl.m).

fFind_fsolve.m - Implementation of zeros finding form finding method. Plots the tensegrity module using both the semicircle model (vertebraePlotSemicircle.m) and stl model (vertebraePlotStl.m).
